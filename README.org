* Emacs Plus

[[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/workflows/CI/badge.svg][file:https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/workflows/CI/badge.svg]]

Emacs Plus is GNU Emacs formulae based on =emacs= [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/emacs.rb][formulae]]. The difference is
that some of the options available from =emacs= formulae are enabled by default
in =emacs-plus= and some new [[#options][additional options]] are available for user.

Patches are extracted from [[https://github.com/d12frosted/emacs-plus-basis][emacs-plus-basis]] repository. And maintained there. If
you are adding new patch, please add them to =homebrew-emacs-plus= repository.

** Install

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
  $ brew install emacs-plus [options]
#+END_SRC

By default (without any addition options) this formula install Cocoa version of
Emacs with support of =gnutls=, =imagemagick=, =librsvg=, =libxml2=, dynamic
modules and multicolor fonts and Spacemacs icon. Please see the list of
available options to disable any bit of default behaviour or add even more
stuff.

In order to install without Spacemacs icon you should use following command.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ brew install emacs-plus --without-spacemacs-icon
#+END_SRC

** Reinstall

If you wish to reinstall =emacs-plus= with new options you should not use
=reinstall= command of =brew= (not related to this formula, it's a general
advice). Instead, you should =uninstall= a package and then install it with new set
of arguments.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ brew uninstall emacs-plus
  $ brew install emacs-plus [options]
#+END_SRC

** Options

To get list of all available options, call ~brew info emacs-plus~. Here is
relevant part from output of that command for your convenience.

#+END_SRC

Note that by default =emacs-plus= builds the Cocoa version of Emacs with
=gnutls=, =imagemagick=, =librsvg= and dynamic modules support by default. Also
it changes default GNU Emacs icon to Spacemacs icon. If you wish to change
defaults, just use =--without-FEATURE= flag.

Note that =--HEAD= builds are not really supported. They may fail to install,
they may crash at run time. Or even worse, they may work as expected. So use this
option at your own risk. And feel free to open up issues you face, just remember
that I am not close enough to Emacs development process to provide you much help
with any arising issues.

*** No Titlebar

This patch is enabled with the =--with-no-titlebar= option. It is meant for use with
window tiling applications like chunkwm or amethyst so that the titlebar you will
never need to click on won't take up screen real estate. If you see gaps between your
emacs frames and other windows, try this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)
#+END_SRC

*** Portable dumper

The portable dumper is a feature that is available with Emacs 27. In order to
get this feature, please use =--HEAD= option.

Please, take a look at it's usage in [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/EXPERIMENTAL.org#spacemacs-dumps-using-the-portable-dumper][Spacemacs]].

*** Xwidgets (webkit)

The original [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsXWidgets][Emacs xwidgets]] builds and works on macOS however must be used with
x11 and hence not practical option on macOS. This version enables xwidgets on
native macOS X Cocoa via embedding a native webkit window.

More details can be seen here [[https://github.com/veshboo/emacs][Veshboo's emacs branch]].

*** System appearance change

This patch is enabled by default and can't be disabled. It adds a hook,
=ns-system-appearance-change-functions=, that is called once the system appearance is
changed. Functions added to this hook will be called with one argument, a symbol
that is either ='light= or ='dark=. This mainly allows loading a different theme
to better match the system appearance.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'ns-system-appearance-change-functions
            #'(lambda (appearance)
                (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
                (pcase appearance
                  ('light (load-theme 'tango t))
                  ('dark (load-theme 'tango-dark t)))))
#+end_src

Note that this hook is run early in the startup process, so if you want your
theme to match the system appearance when Emacs starts, you can register your
function(s) in your =early-init.el=. The hook is NOT run in TTY Emacs sessions.

** Emacs configuration

Emacs is a journey. And for some of you these projects might be inspiring.

** Known Issues

Please checkout [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues][Issues]] page for a list of all known issues. But here are several
you should be aware of.

*** =emacs= dependency in other formulas
In some cases (like when installing =cask=) regular =emacs= package will be
required. In such cases you might want to install all dependencies manually
(except for =emacs=) and then install desired package with
=--ignore-dependencies= option.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ brew install cask --ignore-dependencies
#+END_SRC

** Screenshots

#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_HTML
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/screenshot-02.png">
</p>
#+END_HTML

** Upgrade from Emacs 25.x

With release of Emacs 26.1 many options were removed from the formula, as
features behind them are already in released version.

But most of the users might suffer due to removal of =--natural-title-bar=
option. In order to duplicate its behaviour add following lines to your
=init.el= file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist
               '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))

  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist
               '(ns-appearance . light)) ;; or dark - depending on your theme
#+END_SRC

In case for some reason you still want to use old Emacs 25 formula, it is
available as =emacs-plus@25=.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ brew install emacs-plus@25 [all-your-favourite-options]
#+END_SRC
