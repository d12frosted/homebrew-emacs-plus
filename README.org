Emacs Plus is GNU Emacs formulae based on =emacs= [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/emacs.rb][formulae]]. The difference is
that some of the options available from =emacs= formulae are enabled by default
in =emacs-plus= and some new [[#options][additional options]] are available for user.

** Install
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
$ brew install emacs-plus [options]
#+END_SRC

By default (without any addition options) this formula install Cocoa version of
Emacs with support of =gnutls=, =imagemagick=, =librsvg=, =libxml2=, dynamic
modules and multicolor fonts and Spacemacs icon. Please see the list of
available options to disable any bit of default behaviour or add even more
stuff.

In order to install without Spacemacs icon you should use following command.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ brew install emacs-plus --without-spacemacs-icon
#+END_SRC

** Options
To get list of all available options, call ~brew info emacs-plus~. Here is
relevant part from output of that command for your convenience.

#+END_SRC

Note that by default =emacs-plus= builds the Cocoa version of Emacs with
=gnutls=, =imagemagick=, =librsvg= and dynamic modules support by default. Also
it changes default GNU Emacs icon to Spacemacs icon. If you wish to change
defaults, just use =--without-FEATURE= flag.

Note that =--HEAD= builds are not really supported. They may fail to install,
they may crash at run time. Or even worse, they may work as expected. So use this
option at your own risk. And feel free to open up issues you face, just remember
that I am not close enough to Emacs development process to provide you much help
with any arising issues.

** Emacs configuration
Emacs is a journey. And for some of you these projects might be inspiring.

** Known Issues
Please checkout [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues][Issues]] page for a list of all known issues. But here are several
you should be aware of.

*** =emacs= dependency in other formulas
In some cases (like when installing =cask=) regular =emacs= package will be
required. In such cases you might want to install all dependencies manually
(except for =emacs=) and then install desired package with
=--ignore-dependencies= option.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ brew install cask --ignore-dependencies
#+END_SRC
