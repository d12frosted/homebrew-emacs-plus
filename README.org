Emacs Plus is [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][→ GNU Emacs]] formulae for macOS [[https://brew.sh][→ Homebrew]] package manager. It offers a wide rage of extra functionality over regular [[https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/emacs#default][→ Emacs]] package. Emacs Plus intent is to give the most of 'plus' stuff by default, leaving only controversial options as opt-in. Please refer to [[#options][→ Options]] section for more information.

#+begin_src bash
  $ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
  $ brew install emacs-plus    [options] # install the latest release (Emacs 28)
  $ brew install emacs-plus@29 [options] # install Emacs 29 (master)
  $ brew install emacs-plus@28 [options] # install Emacs 28
  $ brew install emacs-plus@27 [options] # install Emacs 27
  $ brew install emacs-plus@26 [options] # install Emacs 26

** Install

Emacs Plus contains separate formulas for different Emacs versions:

- =emacs-plus= install current release version (Emacs 28);
- =emacs-plus@29= install Emacs 29, development version.
- =emacs-plus@28= install Emacs 28, current release version.
- =emacs-plus@27= install Emacs 27, previous release version;
- =emacs-plus@26= install Emacs 26, previous release version;

  #+begin_src bash
  $ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
  $ brew install emacs-plus    [options] # install the latest release (Emacs 28)
  $ brew install emacs-plus@29 [options] # install Emacs 29
  $ brew install emacs-plus@28 [options] # install Emacs 28
  $ brew install emacs-plus@27 [options] # install Emacs 27
  $ brew install emacs-plus@26 [options] # install Emacs 26
#+end_src

By default (without any addition options) this formula install Cocoa version of Emacs with support of =gnutls=, =imagemagick= (not included by default with =emacs-plus@29= and emacs-plus@29), =librsvg=, =libxml2=, dynamic modules and multicolor fonts. Please see the list of available options to disable any bit of default behaviour or add even more stuff.

** Reinstall

If you wish to reinstall =emacs-plus= with you should not use =reinstall= command of =brew= (not related to this formula, it's a general advice). Instead, you should =uninstall= a package and then =install= it with desired options.

Avoid =reinstall= even if you want to =reinstall= with the same set of options, otherwise you will likely to get compilation errors! For example, [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/218][#218]] and [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/321][#321]].

In short, =brew= doesn't really support options. They break time to time ([[https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/4793][brew#4793]], [[https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7397][brew#7397]], [[https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7498][brew#7498]] to show a few).

** Emacs 26 options

Emacs 26 comes without any available options due to [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/195][→ #195]].

** Options explained

*** No Titlebar

This patch is enabled with the =--with-no-titlebar= option for =emacs-plus@27= and =emacs-plus@28=. It is meant for use with window tiling applications like [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai][→ yabai]], [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm][→ chunkwm]] or [[https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst][→ amethyst]] so that the titlebar won't take up screen real estate. If you see gaps between your emacs frames and other windows, try this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)
#+END_SRC

In =emacs-plus@29= this option is not available anymore as you can achieve the same result using Emacs Lisp by adding the following line in your =early-init.el= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(undecorated . t))
#+end_src

*** Xwidgets (webkit)

Browse the web in Emacs as in modern browser.

The original [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsXWidgets][→ Emacs xwidgets]] builds and works on macOS however must be used with X11 and hence not practical option on macOS. This version enables =xwidgets= on native macOS Cocoa via embedding a native webkit window.

More details can be seen here [[https://github.com/veshboo/emacs][→ Veshboo's emacs branch]].

*** System appearance change

This patch is enabled by default and can't be disabled. It adds a hook, =ns-system-appearance-change-functions=, that is called once the system appearance is changed. Functions added to this hook will be called with one argument, a symbol that is either =light= or =dark=. This mainly allows loading a different theme to better match the system appearance.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/apply-theme (appearance)
    "Load theme, taking current system APPEARANCE into consideration."
    (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
    (pcase appearance
      ('light (load-theme 'tango t))
      ('dark (load-theme 'tango-dark t))))

  (add-hook 'ns-system-appearance-change-functions #'my/apply-theme)
#+end_src

Note that this hook is also run once when Emacs is initialized, so simply adding the above to your =init.el= will allow matching the system appearance upon startup. You can also determine what the current system appearance is by inspecting the value of the =ns-system-appearance= variable.

The hook is NOT run in TTY Emacs sessions.

*** gccemacs

#+begin_quote
gccemacs is a modified Emacs capable of compiling and running Emacs Lisp as native code in form of re-loadable elf files. As the name suggests this is achieved blending together Emacs and the gcc infrastructure.

[[https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html][→ Andrea Corallo]]
#+end_quote

While =gccemacs= gives performance boost in many scenarios, this feature is still experimental and might require time and effort from your side for it to work! Use at our own risk :)

Please see official [[https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html][→ gccemacs documentation]] for more information.

Knows issues:

- =ld: library not found for -lSystem=. This only happens on older versions of =gcc= installed by Homebrew. Please execute =$ brew reinstall gcc libgccjit= to resolve this issue.
- Errors during compilation of your =init.el=. Try running Emacs with =-Q= option and give it some time to compile everything (maybe run =M-x= to force compilation) - you shall see buffer =*Async-native-compile-log*= in the list of buffers.

** Emacs configuration

Emacs is a journey. And for some of you these projects might be inspiring.

- [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][→ Steve Purcell's .emacs.d]]
- [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/][→ Spacemacs]]
- [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][→ doom-emacs]]
- [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][→ Prelude]]

** Known Issues

Please checkout [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues][→ Issues]] page for a list of all known issues. But here are several you should be aware of.

*** =emacs= dependency in other formulas

In some cases (like when installing =cask=) regular =emacs= package will be required. In such cases you might want to install all dependencies manually (except for =emacs=) and then install desired package with =--ignore-dependencies= option.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ brew install cask --ignore-dependencies
#+END_SRC
