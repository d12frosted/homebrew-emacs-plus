#+end_html

Emacs+ is [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][→ GNU Emacs]] formulae for macOS [[https://brew.sh][→ Homebrew]] package manager. It offers a wide range of extra functionality over regular [[https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/emacs#default][→ Emacs]] package. Emacs+ intent is to give the most of 'plus' stuff by default, leaving only controversial options as opt-in. Please refer to [[#options][→ Options]] section for more information.

#+begin_src bash
  $ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
  $ brew install emacs-plus    [options] # install the latest release (Emacs 29)
  $ brew install emacs-plus@31 [options] # install Emacs 31 (master)
  $ brew install emacs-plus@30 [options] # install Emacs 30 (emacs-30)
  $ brew install emacs-plus@29 [options] # install Emacs 29
#+end_src

** Install

Emacs Plus contains separate formulas for different Emacs versions:

- =emacs-plus= install current release version (Emacs 29);
- =emacs-plus@31= install Emacs 31, development version.
- =emacs-plus@30= install Emacs 30, release branch version.
- =emacs-plus@29= install Emacs 29, current version.

  #+begin_src bash
  $ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
  $ brew install emacs-plus    [options] # install the latest release (Emacs 29)
  $ brew install emacs-plus@31 [options] # install Emacs 31
  $ brew install emacs-plus@30 [options] # install Emacs 30
  $ brew install emacs-plus@29 [options] # install Emacs 29
#+end_src

By default (without any addition options) this formula install Cocoa version of Emacs with support of =gnutls=, =imagemagick= (not included by default with =emacs-plus@29=, =emacs-plus@30=, and =emacs-plus@31=), =librsvg=, =libxml2=, dynamic modules and multicolor fonts. Please see the list of available options to disable any bit of default behaviour or add even more stuff.

*** Installing from feature branch

Sometimes you might want to install from a feature branch. In that case you can switch the branch in the tap and install Emacs+ again.

Prerequisites are:

- Emacs+ is tapped (e.g. =brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus=).
- =jq= is available (e.g. =brew install jq=).

Open terminal and type the following commands (don't forget to use correct Emacs+ version, branch and options):

#+begin_src bash
  $ brew uninstall emacs-plus@29
  $ cd $(brew tap-info --json d12frosted/emacs-plus@29 | jq -r '.[0].path') && git switch BRANCH
  $ brew install emacs-plus@29 [OPTIONS]
#+end_src

** Reinstall

If you wish to reinstall =emacs-plus= with you should not use =reinstall= command of =brew= (not related to this formula, it's a general advice). Instead, you should =uninstall= a package and then =install= it with desired options.

Avoid =reinstall= even if you want to =reinstall= with the same set of options, otherwise you will likely to get compilation errors! For example, [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/218][#218]] and [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/321][#321]].

In short, =brew= doesn't really support options. They break time to time ([[https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/4793][brew#4793]], [[https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7397][brew#7397]], [[https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7498][brew#7498]] to show a few).

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

** Features explained

*** Injected PATH

#+begin_quote
Ever find that a command works in your shell, but not in Emacs?

(c) @purcell
#+end_quote

In macOS applications are started in the login environment, meaning that all user defined environment variables are not available in application process. In the most cases it's not a big deal, but in Emacs it becomes a source of troubles as we want to use binaries from the non-standard locations (for example, those installed via package managers).

There is a wonderful solution to overcome this problem, [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][purcell/exec-path-from-shell]]. As with any package that is not preinstalled with Emacs, you need to discover it first, and then install it. And while being a well known package and popular package (top 100 on MELPA), not everyone install it. In addition, with =native-comp= feature you might need it's functionality before any package is bootstrapped.

All that being said, during installation Emacs+ injects value of =PATH= into =Emacs.app/Contents/Info.plist= file, making this value available whenever you start =Emacs.app= from Finder, Docker, Spotlight, =open= command in Terminal or via =launchd=. This solves a wide range of problems for GUI users without the need to use [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][purcell/exec-path-from-shell]], but if needed you can still fall back to this wonderful package, especially if you need other variables.

In case you have a non-trivial setup relying on specific value of =PATH= inherited from current terminal session, it is advised to start Emacs using =/opt/homebrew/bin/emacs= instead of =open -n -a /path/to/Emacs.app=, because =open= messes around with =PATH= value even without Emacs+ injection. You can find more information in [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/469][#469]].

And if for some reason PATH injection doesn't work for you, report it either in [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues/469][#469]] or open a new issue.

*** No Titlebar

| square corners                                    | round corners                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| [[/images/screenshot-no-titlebar-square-corners.png]] | [[/images/screenshot-no-titlebar-round-corners.png]] |

**** Emacs 28 and Emacs 27

This patch is enabled with the =--with-no-titlebar= option for =emacs-plus@27= and =emacs-plus@28=. It is meant for use with window tiling applications like [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai][→ yabai]], [[https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm][→ chunkwm]] or [[https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst][→ amethyst]] so that the titlebar won't take up screen real estate.

Use =--with-no-titlebar-and-round-corners= option (instead of =--with-no-titlebar=), if you want to keep round corners (for example, to be consistent with other macOS applications).

If you see gaps between your emacs frames and other windows, try this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)
#+END_SRC

**** Emacs 29+

In =emacs-plus@29=, =emacs-plus@30=, and =emacs-plus@31= this option is not available anymore as you can achieve the same result using Emacs Lisp by adding the following line in your =early-init.el= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(undecorated . t))
#+end_src

Add the following line instead for round corners:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(undecorated-round . t))
#+end_src

*** Xwidgets (webkit)

Browse the web in Emacs as in modern browser.

The original [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsXWidgets][→ Emacs xwidgets]] builds and works on macOS however must be used with X11 and hence not practical option on macOS. This version enables =xwidgets= on native macOS Cocoa via embedding a native webkit window.

More details can be seen here [[https://github.com/veshboo/emacs][→ Veshboo's emacs branch]].

*** System appearance change

This patch is enabled by default and can't be disabled. It adds a hook, =ns-system-appearance-change-functions=, that is called once the system appearance is changed. Functions added to this hook will be called with one argument, a symbol that is either =light= or =dark=. This mainly allows loading a different theme to better match the system appearance.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/apply-theme (appearance)
    "Load theme, taking current system APPEARANCE into consideration."
    (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
    (pcase appearance
      ('light (load-theme 'tango t))
      ('dark (load-theme 'tango-dark t))))

  (add-hook 'ns-system-appearance-change-functions #'my/apply-theme)
#+end_src

Note that this hook is also run once when Emacs is initialized, so simply adding the above to your =init.el= will allow matching the system appearance upon startup. You can also determine what the current system appearance is by inspecting the value of the =ns-system-appearance= variable.

The hook is NOT run in TTY Emacs sessions.

*** gccemacs

#+begin_quote
gccemacs is a modified Emacs capable of compiling and running Emacs Lisp as native code in form of re-loadable elf files. As the name suggests this is achieved blending together Emacs and the gcc infrastructure.

[[https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html][→ Andrea Corallo]]
#+end_quote

While =gccemacs= gives performance boost in many scenarios, this feature is still experimental and might require time and effort from your side for it to work! Use at our own risk :)

Please see official [[https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html][→ gccemacs documentation]] for more information.

Knows issues:

- =ld: library not found for -lSystem=. This only happens on older versions of =gcc= installed by Homebrew. Please execute =$ brew reinstall gcc libgccjit= to resolve this issue.
- Errors during compilation of your =init.el=. Try running Emacs with =-Q= option and give it some time to compile everything (maybe run =M-x= to force compilation) - you shall see buffer =*Async-native-compile-log*= in the list of buffers.

** Emacs configuration

Emacs is a journey. And for some of you these projects might be inspiring.

- [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][→ Steve Purcell's .emacs.d]]
- [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/][→ Spacemacs]]
- [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][→ doom-emacs]]
- [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][→ Prelude]]

** Known Issues

Please checkout [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/issues][→ Issues]] page for a list of all known issues. But here are several you should be aware of.

*** =emacs= dependency in other formulas

In some cases (like when installing =cask=) regular =emacs= package will be required. In such cases you might want to install all dependencies manually (except for =emacs=) and then install desired package with =--ignore-dependencies= option.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ brew install cask --ignore-dependencies
#+END_SRC

** Old versions

This repository provides formulas for some older version. Feel free to use them, but they are not really supported anymore.

  #+begin_src bash
  $ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
  $ brew install emacs-plus@28 [options] # install Emacs 28
  $ brew install emacs-plus@27 [options] # install Emacs 27
  $ brew install emacs-plus@26 [options] # install Emacs 26
#+end_src

*** Emacs 28

**** Included

By default =emacs-plus@28= uses the following features.

- Injected =PATH= value from user shell (see separate section explaining this feature).
- Cocoa version, e.g. builds =Emacs.app=.
- Unconditional support for =gnutls=, =librsvg=, =libxml2=, =little-cms2= and dynamic modules.

** FAQ

*** How to change/pin commit =emacs-plus@30= is built from

The most current development version is consistently compiled from a specific branch. At the time of this writing, for instance, =emacs-plus@30= is being built from the =emacs-30= branch.

Ordinarily, =brew= will update to the latest commit in the specified branch during installation, meaning the exact commit you're building from varies depending on the installation timing. As development versions are less stable than official releases, some users may prefer to pin a specific commit.

Usually this is done by modifying formula (i.e. by executing =brew edit emacs-plus@30= and altering the =url= directive), but you can also set =HOMEBREW_EMACS_PLUS_30_REVISION= environment variable before installing =emacs-plus@30=:

#+begin_src bash
  $ HOMEBREW_EMACS_PLUS_30_REVISION=6abea4d98d1d964c68a78cb9b5321071da851654 brew install emacs-plus@30 [OPTIONS]
#+end_src

The most current development version is consistently compiled from a specific branch. At the time of this writing, for instance, =emacs-plus@31= is being built from the =master= branch.
