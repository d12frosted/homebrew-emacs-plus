** New Icons

*** liquid-glass

New icon designed for macOS 26 (Tahoe) liquid glass aesthetic. Contributed by [[https://github.com/leaferiksen][leaferiksen]].

*** 17 icons from homebrew-emacs-head

Added icons from the [[https://github.com/daviderestivo/homebrew-emacs-head][homebrew-emacs-head]] project:

- =golden-yak= - by emacsfodder
- =infinity-yak-*= (13 variants) - by emacsfodder
- =modern-paper-icons= - by snwh
- =modern-purple= - by NicolasPetton

** Improvements

*** Icons gallery

All 76 icons are now browsable in a [[./community/icons/README.md][visual gallery]] with previews, author attribution, and source links.

** New Features

*** Revision pinning via build.yml

You can now pin to a specific git revision using =~/.config/emacs-plus/build.yml=:

#+begin_src yaml
revision:
  "30": abc123def456
  "31": 789xyz
#+end_src

The environment variables =HOMEBREW_EMACS_PLUS_XX_REVISION= are now deprecated in favor of this approach. See [[./README.org#how-to-pin-a-specific-commit][documentation]] for details.

*** macOS font rendering fix for CJK text

Added =mac-font-use-typo-metrics= patch (from railwaycat/emacs-mac) that fixes line height calculation for mixed CJK and English text. This resolves issues with partial screen rendering in vterm and other applications.

*** org-protocol support in Emacs Client.app

=Emacs Client.app= now handles =org-protocol://= URLs out of the box. This enables org-capture from browser extensions, org-roam protocol, and other integrations without additional configuration. Just add =(require 'org-protocol)= to your Emacs init file.

** Improvements

*** Better error messages for incompatible options

The formula now errors out early when icon options (=--with-*-icon= or via =build.yml=) are used with =--with-x11= or =--without-cocoa=, since these builds don't produce =Emacs.app=.

*** Clearer documentation for non-Cocoa builds

Updated option descriptions to clarify that =--with-x11= and =--without-cocoa= produce terminal/X11 builds without =Emacs.app=.

*** Library not loaded errors

Added caveat explaining how to fix "Library not loaded" errors after upgrading dependencies like =tree-sitter= or =libgccjit=: simply run =brew reinstall emacs-plus@XX=.

*** Better Spotlight integration

The =emacs= command now automatically finds =Emacs.app= in =/Applications= or =~/Applications=. This allows you to copy the app for better Spotlight indexing:

#+begin_src bash
cp -r "$(brew --prefix)/opt/emacs-plus@30/Emacs.app" /Applications/
#+end_src

The =emacs= command will continue to work without any manual adjustments.

** Community Patches

*** Window blurring and alpha transparency

New community patch adds support for window blurring and configurable alpha transparency effects.

*** Async process read performance

New community patch improves async process read performance.

* 2025-12-14

** New Features

*** Community patches and icons system

Introduced a new system for community-contributed patches and icons via =~/.config/emacs-plus/build.yml=. This allows users to easily apply patches and icons from a community registry or external URLs.

The =--with-*-icon= options are now deprecated (removal date: 2026-03-14). Please migrate to =build.yml=.

See [[./community/README.md][Community Documentation]] for details.

* 2025-11-24

** New Features

*** Emacs Client.app

Starting with =emacs-plus@30= and =emacs-plus@31=, the formula now includes =Emacs Client.app= - a companion application for opening files in Emacs from Finder, Spotlight, and other macOS applications. It connects to an existing Emacs daemon using =emacsclient=.

*** macOS 26 (Tahoe) compatibility

Fixed =Emacs Client.app= icon display on macOS 26+ by removing =Assets.car=.

* 2025-10-17

** New Features

*** PATH injection for macOS Sequoia

Fixed PATH injection on macOS 15 (Sequoia) which was ignoring =LSEnvironment= in =Info.plist=. The fix uses a wrapper script to inject PATH from your shell.

To disable PATH injection:
#+begin_src bash
export EMACS_PLUS_NO_PATH_INJECTION=1
#+end_src

* 2025-08-15

** Releases

*** Emacs 30.2

Updated =emacs-plus@30= to Emacs 30.2.

* 2025-02-23

** Releases

*** Emacs 30.1

Released =emacs-plus@30= with Emacs 30.1 - the first stable release of Emacs 30.

** Changes

*** Emacs 30 is now the default

=emacs-plus= (without version suffix) now installs Emacs 30 instead of Emacs 29.

*** Native compilation enabled by default

Native compilation is now enabled by default for Emacs 30+. The =--with-native-comp= option is no longer needed.

*** libjansson dependency removed

The =libjansson= dependency was removed for Emacs 30.1+ as it's no longer required.
