Refresh x-colors during NS window system initialization

On NS Emacs, x-colors is set by calling ns-list-colors at dump time
(in common-win.el).  When the dump is created in a headless environment,
ns-list-colors returns only ~62 colors, while at runtime with a display
it returns the full list (~800+).

Refresh x-colors from ns-list-colors during window-system-initialization
for NS, when the display is available.

* lisp/term/ns-win.el (window-system-initialization): Refresh x-colors.
